# Coffee posts

This is my React Native implementation of [Zesty's simple rn app](https://github.com/zesty-app/simple-rn-app)
using the required API and Typescript.

One can, as requested:
 - [x] write whatever text you want in the text input at the top
 - [x] add posts to the top of the list when you click the `Publier` button
 - [x] scroll vertically to see all the posts
